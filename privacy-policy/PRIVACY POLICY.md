# This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and sharing of personal information by Ping Control, a Discord bot developed by Unknown_303. By using Ping Control, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

We collect information that you provide to us through your use of the bot, such as your Discord Server's ID, and the names of specific roles. 
Ping Control may temporarily process message content in memory to perform its functions, but message content is not stored or logged.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to operate Ping Control, so that the correct settings are applied. 
We may also use your information as required by applicable law or to respond to lawful requests.

## Sharing Your Information

We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties. 
However, we may disclose your information in response to legal process or a request from a law enforcement agency or regulatory authority.

## Data Retention

Data collected by Ping Control (such as server IDs and role names) is retained even if the bot is removed from a server. 
Data is only deleted upon explicit request by the server owner. If you wish your data to be removed, please see how to contact us below.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. 
However, no security measure is foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we will post the updated policy at the same public link where this is available. 
Your continued use of Ping Control after we make changes to this policy indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
